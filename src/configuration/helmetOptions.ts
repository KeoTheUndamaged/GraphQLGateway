/**
 * Helmet Security Headers Configuration
 *
 * Helmet sets various HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
 * This configuration is optimised for GraphQL APIs with optional GraphQL Playground support.
 *
 * Security Headers Applied:
 * - Content Security Policy (CSP): Prevents XSS and code injection attacks
 * - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS): Enforces HTTPS connections
 * - X-Frame-Options: Prevents clickjacking attacks
 * - X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents MIME type confusion attacks
 * - Referrer Policy: Controls referrer information leakage
 * - Cross-Origin Policies: Protects against cross-origin attacks
 *
 * GraphQL-Specific Considerations:
 * - CSP policies must accommodate GraphQL Playground (development only)
 * - API endpoints typically don't need frame embedding or external resources
 * - Security vs Development usability trade-offs

/**
 * PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
 *
 * 1. âœ… Ensure HTTPS is properly configured before enabling HSTS
 * 2. âœ… Test GraphQL Playground is disabled in production (CSP will block it)
 * 3. âœ… Verify CSP doesn't break legitimate client applications
 * 4. âœ… Test API functionality with all security headers enabled
 * 5. âœ… Consider enabling HSTS preload only after thorough testing
 * 6. âœ… Monitor for CSP violations in browser console/logs
 * 7. âœ… Validate headers using security scanning tools
 *
 * DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATION:
 *
 * - GraphQL Playground requires to be relaxed CSP (unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval)
 * - These relaxations are automatically applied when ENABLE_GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND=true
 * - Never enable playground in production environments
 *
 * SECURITY TESTING:
 *
 * - Use tools like security headers.com to validate your configuration
 * - Test for XSS vulnerabilities with relaxed CSP in development
 * - Verify HSTS works correctly with your HTTPS setup
 * - Test cross-origin scenarios match your CORS configuration
 *
 * MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS:
 *
 * - Monitor CSP violation reports for potential attacks or misconfigurations
 * - Track HSTS policy violations (users on HTTP when HTTPS required)
 * - Log security header violations for analysis
 * - Consider implementing CSP reporting endpoints
 *
 * COMMON ISSUES:
 *
 * - CSP blocking legitimate resources: Adjust directives or add specific sources
 * - HSTS preventing HTTP access: Ensure HTTPS is working before enabling
 * - Frame blocking breaking embedded use cases: Consider adjusting frameguard
 * - Referrer policy breaking analytics: May need to adjust based on requirements
